# Attacco-DoS
A simple and very minimal program to perform DoS attacks

# Types of use
This program, written entirely in python, has only an informative purpose, so its use is recommended only locally or with privately owned machines to which you have access. 

# Creation
It has been created taking cue from some programs on the web with the purpose to get an optimized and fast one.

# Help
Any type of substantial change is welcome, in addition I am at full disposal for collaborations
